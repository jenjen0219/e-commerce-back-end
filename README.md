# E-Commerce Back End - Object Relational Mapping (ORM) 

## Description
E-commerce takes up a large portion of how people shop for their needs and wants. This project is the back end to an e-commerce website where there are various categories of which have multiple products. Each product then has their corresponding product tag that helps with further categorizing each item.  

<br>
There was starter code provided for this project with well-written instructions for how to build each column for every component within this database. However, I did run into some issues with properly setting up the category route. There was some back and forth among my research but I eventually figured it out! 
<br>
<br>
There is no live link to this project, instead, here is a video of the program running the necessary back end functionality through Insonmia.
